### :wave: Hi, I'm Elsa
### TLDR: 
* I love making a new friend, please drop a message [here](https://twitter.com/goosetheintern) (👯 especially if you want to work together on a project)


### 👩🏻‍💻 Dev (and other) things that I am currently interested in: 
* Re-doing my portfolio website
* properly re-building [vegeverse contracts](https://github.com/soloplxya/vegeverse-solidity-template) (after properly learning solidity) 
* making games using SparkAR and making my own assets for them (blender)
* how can we use blockchain to push for a more sustainable world


### 🌱 Currently learning: 
* (by myself): Solidity + Hardhat
* (at school): Cryptography + Computer Vision + Software security
